Missing attribute values: 16

Class distribution:

Benign: 458 (65.5%)
Malignant: 241 (34.5%)

Data Processing:
the missing values in the columns are replaced by the median value of that column. since we observed that some
# columns hav outliers, and mean is heavily affected by outliers, we fill them with medians.
All columns are int except 'Bare Nuclei' is String - to represent '?'. We must first convert the column to int
